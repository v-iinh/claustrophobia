## Instructions

Avoid obstacles by pressing either the A or D key to move. Right clicking transfers a player between the game and the homepage. Left clicking changes the camera position around the player. Points grow higher the longer a player survives, and lower if they hit an obstacle. Players will lose if they hit an obstacle while under 200 points, and win once they reach 500.
